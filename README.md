# Knights on a Chess board
This is a C++ solution to the knights problem:

Given two positions, source and destination, on a blank chess board, list the sequence of legal moves a knight would have to move from source to destination. 

This is essentially a problem of finding the shortest path between two nodes in a connected graph and is solved using breadth first search.
